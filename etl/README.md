# HTAN RDF (JSON-LD) to MDF

The script in this package, ```htan-rdf-to-mdf.py```, converts the HTAN JSON-LD version of
its data model to [Model Description Format](https://github.com/CBIIT/bento-mdf).

The latest HTAN data model is currently found [here](https://github.com/ncihtan/data-models),
and is a submodule of this repo.
